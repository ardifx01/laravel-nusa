            ->where('type', 'shipping')
            ->where('is_default', true)
            ->first()?->getShippingZone();
    }
}

// Store locator with distance calculation
class Store extends Model
{
    use WithCoordinate, WithAddress;
    
    public function findNearbyStores($userLat, $userLng, $radiusKm = 10)
    {
        return static::nearby($userLat, $userLng, $radiusKm)
            ->with('address.village.regency.province')

}
```

## Getting Started

### 1. **Choose Your Traits**

Select traits based on your business needs:
- **Single location**: Use `WithVillage` or `WithAddress`
- **Multiple locations**: Use `WithAddresses`
- **Geographic features**: Add `WithCoordinate`
- **Regional management**: Use `WithProvince` or `WithRegency`

### 2. **Implement in Your Models**

```php
use Creasi\Nusa\Models\Concerns\WithVillage;

}
```

### 3. **Update Your Database**

```php
Schema::table('customers', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('village_code')->nullable();
    $table->foreign('village_code')->references('code')->on('villages');
});
```

### 4. **Start Building**

```php
$customer = Customer::with('village.regency.province')->first();
echo "Customer from: {$customer->village->name}, {$customer->village->regency->name}";
```
