            ->first();
    }

    {
        $address = $this->getDefaultShippingAddress();

}
```

    public function getLocationsByType($type)
    {
        return $this->addresses()
            ->where('type', $type)
            ->with(['village.regency.province'])
            ->get();
    }

    public function getRegionalCoverage()
    {
        return $this->addresses()
            ->with('province')
            ->get()
            ->groupBy('province.name')
            ->map(function ($addresses, $province) {
                return [
                    'province' => $province,
                    'locations' => $addresses->count(),
                    'types' => $addresses->pluck('type')->unique()
                ];
            });
